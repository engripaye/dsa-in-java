# 🧠 60 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to the **60-Day Java DSA Mastery Challenge** 🎯  
This repository is a complete hands-on roadmap to **master data structures and algorithms in Java** — from fundamentals to interview-level mastery.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This challenge helps you:
- Strengthen your **core DSA concepts**.
- Build **problem-solving** and **analytical thinking**.
- Prepare for **Java coding interviews**.
- Maintain daily progress with **structured learning**.

🗓 **Duration:** 60 Days  
💻 **Language:** Java 21  
📂 **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VSCode  
🏁 **Goal:** Become interview-ready for top software engineering roles.
